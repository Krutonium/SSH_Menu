# SSH_Menu
A program that lists and allows easy connection to SSH Servers in C#

Basically once you have this installed, you can go ahead and run it and it will give you a menu of servers you can connect to.
It can automatically pass your password for you if you wish, with the assistance of sshpass, or you can use certificates.
Or you can type in your password like a Neandrathal or somthing. Either way this makes it super easy to use, as it can use
hostnames, IP's, or anything else that works with SSH to connect to SSH servers super easily.

You can add an unlimited number of servers to connect to, and they should all work. If you're not using password based authentication, simply leave the password field blank.
